Something I've wanted for a long time: a way to "replay" RSS feeds of old blogs.

I'm constantly stumbling upon now-defunct blogs with tons of high quality content, like Less Wrong.

I can't help but feel like I've missed the bus. It's one thing to lurk through their archives and it's another to experience the posts as they're written real-time. You miss out on rebuttal articles, on shifting themes, and on a good amount of the context in the comments.
