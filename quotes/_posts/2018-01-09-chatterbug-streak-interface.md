Streaks are super motivating and I was very disappointed when GitHub removed the counter for their streaks.

I really like this interface on Chatterbug. It gives way more context for what actually happened than GitHub and it includes a helpful recap of what you've done in the past week. Might be cool to also show what you did the week before to compare progress?
